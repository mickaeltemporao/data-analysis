## Theory

GitHub and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) are transformative tools that enhance both collaboration and productivity. GitHub, is a powerful platform for version control, allows to manage and track changes to their code and research projects efficiently. It facilitates seamless collaboration among researchers, enabling them to share, review, and merge contributions from multiple authors. This is particularly valuable in interdisciplinary projects or when working with large datasets. Meanwhile, VSCode serves as a versatile text editor, offering a robust environment for coding, writing, and managing research documents.

Together, GitHub and VSCode empower researchers to conduct rigorous, reproducible research while fostering a collaborative research culture.
