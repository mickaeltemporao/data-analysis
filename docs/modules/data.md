## Theory
### Presentation & Discussion
- [Brady, H. E., Verba, S., & Schlozman, K. L. (1995). Beyond SES: A resource model of political participation. American political science review, 89(2), 271-294.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/beyond-ses-aresource-model-of-political-participation/CE74BA78807755F0A09E589D631EB03E)

## Variable Types & Levels of Measurement

Variables can broadly be categorized as either **discrete** or **continuous**. 

- **Discrete variables** are those that take on a countable number of values, meaning they can only be whole numbers. An example of a discrete variable is the number of voters in an election, which might be represented as 3,450 voters. 
- **Continuous variables** can take on an infinite number of values within a given range, allowing for more precise measurement. For instance, the time it takes for respondents to answer a survey can be a continuous variable, such as 2.5 minutes, indicating that time can be measured in fractions and is not limited to whole numbers. 

| Levels | Description                                      | Example                                  |
|:-------------:|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Nominal       | Categories without any mathematical relation.    | Party Identification (e.g., Democrat Republican) |
| Ordinal       | Categories with a meaningful order but unequal intervals. | Level of education (e.g., high school, bachelor's, master's, phd, ...) |
| Interval      | Numeric values with meaningful intervals but no true zero. | Feeling Thermometer (e.g., survey responses on a scale from 0 to 100) |
| Ratio         | Numeric values with meaningful intervals and a true zero. | Age of a respondent (e.g., 25 years old) |

### Let's practice:

- Political Ideology - Measured on a scale (e.g., liberal to conservative)
- Voter Turnout - Percentage of eligible voters who vote
- Campaign Expenditure - Total amount of money spent on a campaign
- Attitudes towards a government spending - Measured on a scale likert scale ranging from 1 to 7
- Age of Respondents - Measured in categories (e.g. 18-25, 26-45, 46-65, 66+)
- Gender - Categorical variable (e.g., male, female, non-binary, other)
- Political Participation - Scale measuring levels of engagement (e.g., none, some, active)

## For next time
- Identify how to measure your concepts and which variables from ANES you could use for your project.
