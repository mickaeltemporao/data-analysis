    To load and use a notebook in VS Code follow the steps 3 to 5 in [📘 Notebooks in VS Code](../resources/notebook-vscode.md)

- To start, download and open the notebooks directly in VS Code:
    - Get the [:fontawesome-solid-file-code: **Notebooks**](https://github.com/mickaeltemporao/data-analysis-codespace/tree/main/notebooks) from the GitHub repository

## **Application**
### Start your Research Project Notebook
- In **VS Code**, create a new **Jupyter Notebook** (`.ipynb` file) to serve as the foundation for your research project.
- Begin developing and organising relevant code and analyses that contribute to your reproducible research paper (your final project).
