# Onboarding

Make sure you have completed the following activities before the second class meeting:

1. Create a [:fontawesome-brands-google: **Colaboratory**](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) account.
    - You can use an existing :fontawesome-brands-google: Google account or create a new one.
    - This is the main tool we will use to complete all of the courses activities.
2. Join this course's [:fontawesome-regular-comment: **Chat**](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3Avu56gi47cWMRcApqmqVDMcIfFqH2ii-xZfqAngUNH7w1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=5a6b90cb-a892-49a9-ad95-ad20235b7673&tenantId=d9315e4a-c1e0-43e9-b21d-2e94e2cafc7f) 
    - Log in with your **Sciences Po Bordeaux** email (firstname.lastname@scpobx.fr). The password is your ENT password.
    - Join the `data-analysis-2024-2025` team.
    - Post a message, or ay hi in the General channel.
    - This is the primary communication tool outside class meetings.

For now, you can explore these tools by yourself. If these tools don't make sense yet do not worry. We'll cover them in the upcoming class meetings.

More resources will continue to be added throughout the course length. You should check the [Resources](#resources) pages regularly!
