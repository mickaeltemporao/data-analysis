Do social media polarize the electorate? How can we measure ideology? How can we predict election outcomes? What factors explain voting behaviour? These are just a few of the numerous questions that social scientists are tackling with quantitative data. Beyond academia, companies and non-profits have invested heavily in data science techniques to learn about their users, platforms, and programs. Data scientists at these institutions are essentially applied social scientists and employ many of the same techniques you will learn in this course.
