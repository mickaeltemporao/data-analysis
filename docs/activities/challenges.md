# 30% | Milestones

Milestones provide students with the opportunity to learn incrementally and builds up to a fully reproducible scientific paper. There will be some time during the class meetings to start working on these milestones, and to address questions, but most of it will be completed after class.

!!! warning
    **The milestones are ALWAYS due before the beginning of the next class meeting.**

## Milestone Workflow

Each milestone will be posted at least **5 days before its due date**, giving you time to plan, complete, and review your work.

1. Open the milestone by clicking the milestone icon :fontawesome-solid-award: on the [Schedule](../schedule.md) page.
2. Read the milestone instructions carefully, and follow the steps to complete the required tasks.
3. Submission guidelines are provided within each milestone. Make sure to review them before turning in your work.

## Grading
Milestones will be graded on a 4-category scale:
