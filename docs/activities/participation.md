# 30% | Participation

The participation grade is divided into three parts: a student presentation, a student discussion, and student engagement.

## **:fontawesome-solid-chalkboard-teacher: Presentation**
During class meetings, a student group will make 15 minute presentation during which they will discuss a scientific paper.
The student group prepares a two-page reading note, due 24 hours before the class meeting and a 15 minute presentation during which they will discuss their assessment of the paper. All students in the class are expected to at least have skimmed the papers and be ready to ask questions or engage in the discussion.

## **:fontawesome-regular-comment-dots: Discussion**
After each presentation, a student is randomly selected to be the discussant. The discussant makes a 5 minute comment on the paper and the presentation. He brings a new perspective to the table. The discussant's grade will be assigned to the group to whom the discussant belongs.


## **:fontawesome-regular-comments: Engagement**
Students are expected to be active during the class meetings and actively participating and engaging in the ongoing class activities.
Students are also expected to be active on the communication platform, that is by asking questions or by helping their peers when they have questions. For more details see the [Communication](../../#communication) guidelines in the syllabus.
