## Instructions

### The Setup
Before you can start this milestone, you need to have a [**typst**](https://typst.app/) account. You need to use typst to write, save and share your work.

### The Milestone
1. Create an Empty Document on the [**typst.app**](https://typst.app/).
2. Write a summary paragraph of your project idea.
    - Your idea is related to american political behaviour and/or public opinion.
    - You introduce a puzzle, mention what your research question is and formulate a hypothesis based on what you know today.
    - Format your in-text citations using the [APA format](https://www.mendeley.com/guides/apa-citation-guide).
    - Add a title above your paragraph.
2. Use [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or [Cairn](https://www.cairn.info/) to identify two scientific articles published in major academic journals.
    - You need to use (cite) at least two scientific articles in your summary paragraph.
3. Add a "References" section at the end of paragraph with your references.
    - Add all the references in [APA format](https://www.mendeley.com/guides/apa-citation-guide).

**Bonus:** Can you include links to each of the references by linking them to the webpages of the scientific articles?

### Submission Guidelines

1. When you have completed your milestone, **export your work from Typst as both**:
    * a `.pdf` version of your milestone
    * the `.typ` source file
2. Submit **both files together** in the General Chat.
3. **File Naming:** To help keep submissions organized, use a consistent format such as:

```
da-milestone1-group1.typ
da-milestone1-group1.pdf
```

This keeps it easy to identify your files and ensures nothing gets lost.
