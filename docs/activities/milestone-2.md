# Milestone 2 - Proposal

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this milestone, you should be able to:

- Clearly state your **research question**.
- Formulate a **testable hypothesis** linked to your question.
- Identify your **dependent (DV)** and key **independent (IV)** variable.
- Define and discuss key **concepts** related to your topic.
- Strengthen your **literature review** using peer-reviewed research.
- Outline how your project connects to **empirical analysis**.


## 🧠 Tips for Success

* **Choose a clear question.** A good research question is specific, measurable, and focused on a relationship between variables (e.g., "Does political trust affect voter turnout in the U.S.?").

!!! tip inline end
    Start keeping track of ANES 2024 variables (e.g., `V241043`) that could be used as your DV, IV, CV.

* **Define concepts precisely.** Avoid vague terms, say *how* you'll measure them in ANES (include variable names if possible).

* **Revise carefully.** This proposal will serve as the foundation of your final paper—clarity and precision now will save time later!

## 🧩 The Milestone

In this milestone, you will begin drafting the **introduction** section of your final paper.
Think of it as an extended and improved version of your initial project idea. Remember that you will need to leverage the * 2024 American National Election Study (ANES)* dataset to tackle your research question.

Your introduction should include **five paragraphs**, supported by **at least five scientific articles** (peer-reviewed journal articles preferred).

You need to :

- Create a document in [Typst](https://typst.app/) that follows the template below to complete the Milestone. Your final document is **1000 words max.**

- Use your Milestone 1 as a starting point. You can copy/paste and revise based on received feedback.

- Use [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) to find 5+ scientific articles. Create a `references.bib` file that includes the scientific articles.

- **Leverage citations properly.**  cite sources with `@` in your Typst document. Format everything in *Chicago author-date* style. You show that you can connect your project with the existing scientific literature. 


## 💾 Submission Guidelines

* Delete any **instructions** before submitting your work.

1. Export **both** files from Typst:
    - `da-milestone2-group0.typ`
    - `da-milestone2-group0.pdf`
2. Keep file names consistent so submissions stay organized.
3. Submit **both files** in the General Chat.

## Your Paper Title...
### Optional subtitle
#### Group 0
#### Author 1, Author 2, Author 3

### Introduction

**Paragraph 1 The Puzzle & Context:** Introduce the phenomenon or political question that motivates your project. Explain *why it matters* for political science and why it's worth studying using ANES data.

**Paragraph 2 What We Know:** Summarize what previous research has found on your topic. Highlight main theories or approaches. Focus on *scientific articles* rather than books.

**Paragraph 3 The Dependent Variable (DV):** Define what you are trying to explain (the outcome). Discuss how this concept is measured, why it's important, and any challenges in operationalizing it.

**Paragraph 4 The Independent Variable (IV) & Hypothesis:** Explain what you think drives variation in your DV. Clearly state your **hypothesis** and discuss how your IV might affect the DV. Mention potential control variables if relevant.

**Paragraph 5 Next Steps & Challenges:** Conclude with what comes next for your project (e.g., testing your hypothesis, exploring data). Discuss any potential challenges and how you might address them.

**BONUS Visualize your model:**. Add a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** to illustrate relationships between your variables (DV, IV, controls), and reference your DAG in where appropriate. You can use a tool like [Miro](https://miro.com) to create and export your DAG.
