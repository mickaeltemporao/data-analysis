# Milestone 4 - Analysis

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this milestone, you should be able to:

* **Clean and transform** your variables for rigorous analysis.
* **Produce analytical figures** that explore relationships between variables and assess your theoretical expectations.
* **Interpret patterns** in relation to your research question.


## 🧠 Tips for Success

- **Prepare your data.** Document every transformation you make and justify your choices.
- **Choose appropriate visualizations.** Different relationships require different plot types (scatter plots for continuous variables, box plots for group comparisons, etc.).
- **Connect figures to hypothesis.** Every visualization should help you assess an aspect of your research question.


## 🧩 The Milestone

Building on Milestone 3's basic exploration, you will now conduct a **more sophisticated analysis** that goes beyond the exploration of single variables. This milestone emphasizes an **initial hypothesis assessment through visualization**.

You need to:

- Use your Milestone 3 (.typst file and .ipynb) as a starting point, incorporating any feedback received.
- Apply data cleaning, transformation, and analysis techniques learned in recent [modules](https://github.com/mickaeltemporao/materials/tree/main/notebooks)
    - `04-data-exploration-columns.ipynb`
    - `05-data-exploration-rows.ipynb`
    - `06-data-management-existing-values.ipynb`
- Update your analysis with improved visualizations that examine relationships between variables and assess your initial theoretical expectations.

### What is expected from a **manuscript** perspective

Your Milestone 4 typst file is an updated Milestone 3 typst file that:

- **Does not exceed 3,000 words** (excluding references, figures, and captions)
- **Incorporates new figures**: Integrate new figures with your analytical visualizations from M4
- **Adding interpretation sections**: Write paragraphs connecting each figure to your theoretical expectations
- **Updating literature review**: Expand insights gained from scale construction or variable relationships and how do they compare to the existing literature.
- **Any analytical choices** in your code should have support with academic literature. Cite methodological sources that support your approach to combining variables (e.g., Political knowledge is traditionally measured using questions such as ... @author2020scale)
- **Typst syntax**: Ensure proper citation format using `@citationkey` for all academic references

### What is expected from a **coding** perspective

Similarly, your Milestone 4 ipynb file is an updated Milestone 3 ipynb file that: 

1. Data Cleaning and Variable Preparation
    - **Filter invalid responses**: Remove or recode missing values, "don't know," and refusal responses
    - **Handle outliers**: Identify and address extreme values that may distort analysis
    - **Create clean variables**: Document all transformations and justify your choices
2. Scale Construction (when applicable)
    - **Identify related variables**: Find multiple questions measuring the same concept
    - **Create additive scales**: Combine variables into robust composite measures
 3. Analytical Visualization
     - **Scale Visualization**: Create visual representations of your constructed scales when applicable
    - **Test IV-DV relationship**: Create figures that directly examine your main hypothesis
    - **Control for key variables**: Include subgroup analyses or control variables where relevant
    - **Interpret patterns**: Explain what the figures reveal about your theoretical expectations


## 💾 Submission Guidelines

1. Export final files from both Typst and your notebook:
    - `da-milestone4-group0.typ`
    - `da-milestone4-group0.pdf`
    - `da-m4-notebook-group0.ipynb`
2. Keep file names consistent for organization.
3. Submit **three files** in the General Chat.
4. Manuscript length must not exceed **3000 words** (excluding references, figures, and captions).

This milestone represents a step toward your final paper, marking an initial step towards bridging descriptive exploration with hypothesis testing.
