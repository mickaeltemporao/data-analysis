# Milestone 3 - Exploration

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this milestone, you should :

* Have extended your **literature review** with more peer-reviewed research.
* Started preliminary **data analysis** of your project using ANES 2024.
* **Visualized your dependent (DV)** and main **independent variable (IV)**.


## 🧠 Tips for Success

- **Keep your research question in focus.** Every element should relate directly to your DV and IV.
- **Identify your concepts precisely.** Describe how they relate to one or multiple ANES 2024 variable names (e.g., `V241043`) and explain your measurement choices.
- **Explain your figures**. Always write a short interpretation of what each visualization shows about your variable.


## 🧩 The Milestone

In this milestone, you will conduct a **preliminary exploration** of your project. This builds upon the previous milestones, incorporates any feedback received from the instructor until now, and includes **basic data analysis and visualisations**.

You need to :

- Download the following typst template file : [da-milestone3-group0.typ](https://github.com/mickaeltemporao/data-analysis/blob/main/docs/materials/da-milestone3-group0.typ)
    - Upload the document to [Typst](https://typst.app/) website.
    - Follow the instructions inside the newly uploaded typst document. 
    - Use should use your Milestone 2 as a starting point. You can copy/paste and revise based on any feedback received.

- Download the following notebook file : [da-m3-notebook-group0.ipynb](https://github.com/mickaeltemporao/data-analysis/blob/main/docs/materials/da-m3-notebook-group0.ipynb)
    - Open the notebook in VS Code and follow the instructions in it. 
    - You need to use this notebook to produce at two figures that you will integrate in the Typst file.
    - Keep the Python code used to produce the figures in the notebook.

You will move back and forth between Typst and the notebook as you refine your analysis.


## 💾 Submission Guidelines

* Delete any **instructions** in the files before submitting your work.

1. Export the final typst, a rendered PDF and your notebook files:
    - `da-milestone3-group0.typ`
    - `da-milestone3-group0.pdf`
    - `da-m3-notebook-group0.ipynb`
2. Adjust the file names and keep them consistent so submissions stay organized.
3. Submit 3 files in the General Chat.
