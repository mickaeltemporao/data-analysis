# 40% | Project

Students are required to submit a group project, in the form of a co-authored and reproducible research paper that uses some of the methods and tools introduced during the course. You will apply the skills and concepts learned in this course to answer a research question that can be tackled with the [ANES 2020](https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2020-time-series-study/) dataset. The objective behind the constraint on the data is to get you working with real data on a research project as quickly as possible. In this paper, you will prepare the data, visualize and describe your data, discuss the limitations of the data, carry out a motivated and valid model implementation, and assess the strengths and weaknesses of your model.

## Grading

The project will be evaluated based on four criteria:

| Criteria         | Description                                                               |
| :-:              | -                                                                         |
| **Code**         | The code is of good quality and appropriately documented.                 |
| **Methods**      | The statistical methods applied to the data and question are appropriate. |
| **Mechanics**    | The paper exhibits a good command of academic prose.                      |
| **Organization** | The paragraphs support the main argument in a coherent way.               |
