You will be able to read and understand the methodology of most academic articles in the social sciences, but more importantly you will have a foot in the door of the data science world. The ability to collect and analyze data in a sophisticated manner has become a crucial skill set for the modern job market across industries. Through a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, and a final project, you will learn how to clean, visualize, and interpret complex datasets, gaining valuable insights into citizens' attitudes, behaviors, and broader political trends.
