        "\n",
        "1. **Click** on *'File' -> 'Save a copy in Drive'*\n",
        "    - A new notebook is created named \"Copy of ...\".\n",

        "\n",
        "1. The first paragraph introduces a puzzle and provides context to illustrate why your research question matters.\n",
        "2. The second paragraph emphasizes what has been done in terms of empirical research on your topic and introduces relevant concepts related to the phenomenon you are trying to understand based on what other scholars have done (focus on scientific articles and avoid books).\n",
        "3. The third paragraph focuses on the dependent variable (DV) - what phenomenon are trying to explain? You define your DV in this paragraph and discuss some of the opportunities and challenges related to it.\n",
        "4. The fourth paragraph focuses on the independent variable (IV) - what could explain the changes you observe in the phenomenon you are insterested in? Make a hypothesis. Define your IV and discuss some of the opportunities and challenges related to it.\n",

        "3. Send a **private message** to the instructor using the Chat\n",
